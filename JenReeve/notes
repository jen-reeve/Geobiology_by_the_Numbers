# Class notes

using [Tellurium](tellurium.analogmachine.org) which is built for biological networks (aka metabolic networks)

If you want get Systems Biology: Introduction to Pathway Modeling (on the [analogmachine website](http://books.analogmachine.org/))

Boz wants to be able to go to sites like [Biomodels](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/) (where can browse 10k models) and mess around. Tellurium makes it very easy to import models from Biomodels.

Today let's install and play with some simple models.

Boz's goals for the class:
* get familiar with kinetic modeling platform
* use to reproduce some figures from paper from Halevy and Wing 2014 (sulfate reduction modeling)
* to use platform to calculate isotopic fraction in networks
* to enter a proposed early network and then test it
* another early metabolic network model

### concentration of a single molecule in an E. coli cell
Guess radius to be 1um, so the volume (assuming a cube) is 1um^3. There are 1000L in 1m^3 and 1mL is 1cm3. The volume of the cell in L is 1x10^(-15)L

1 molecule is 1x10^(-24)moles

So the concentration of 1 molecule in an E. coli cell is 1x10^(-9)M aka 1nM so this is the lowest possible concentration of a metabolite/substance of interest in a cell. And while we are in the nM range we can't have halves.

The total concentration of stuff in an E. coli cell is ~100mM.

For the future, use [Bionumbers](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/search.aspx) or [Cell Biology by the Numbers](book.bionumbers.org)

### Running code?!
Successfully ran the simple and slightly more complex examples in the Tellurium Notebook interface

We also tested defining models using the usage example method of defining the model. This also introduces the ability to define compartments.

Book for Earth system model: Mathematical modeling of Earth's Dynamic Systems

For next week, think about explicit examples that you would like to reproduce using this platform (id papers or models). If you have time play with it a little bit. Come in with one new thing that you have discovered. And buy the Systems Bio book!

Things to not do: biochemistry

Try to find pathways where the steps are known and the kinetics are constrained.

Maybe present models as final SuperLab meeting.

Build a simple graphical representation of the model we want to tackle. We don't want to create new biology, want to take a conceptual model from the literature and build a Tellurium/Antimony model of it.

Looking at the Log Plotting (Calzone) example notebook.

What do the compartment units mean? Probably volume units to change the concentration values into total units.

Often good to start at the end of your metabolic network as the final steps are often considered to be irreversible. A useful fiction.

Quick derivation of this type of transformation that is enzymatically catalyzed (from Noor et. al. 2013 paper):

"Quantum" (unit) process of biochemistry can be represented graphically: Substrate + Enzyme <=> Enzyme-Substrate (Complex)=> Product + Enzyme

This is Michaelis-Menten model (but we will call it the Menten model because she deserves all the credit).

Three kinetic parameters for the model: k_(+1) (forward direction of first step), k_(-1) (reverse direction of the first step), k_(+2) (forward direction of the second step).

We know from elementary chemical theory that the rate of this reaction is equal to the rate of accumulation of the product.

dP/dt = V(S) (where V(S) is the reaction velocity which is dependent on the concentration of the substrate)

This doesn't depend on the concentration of the product, but definitely depends on the concentration of substrate

V(S) = k_(+2) * C (the complex)

Menten assumed that the concentration of the substrate was much much greater than the concentration of the enzyme. so: d(ES)/dt = dC/dt = 0

You end up with a pair of rate laws that reflect these transformations.

1. (k_(+2)+k_(-1)) C = k_(+1) S * E (consumption of the enzyme-substrate complex is equal to the production of the enzyme-substrate complex).

   These rate constants have different units. Consumption has units per time. Production has units of per time*something

2. E_(total) = E + C

   The total enzyme present is equal to the free enzyme times the amount bound up in a complex

E = E_(total) - C

\[
(k_(+2)+k_(-1)) C + k_(+1) S * C = k_(+1) E_(total) * S
\]

$$C = (k_(+1) E_(total) * S) / ((k_(+2)+k_(-1)) + k_(+1) * S) = (E_(total) * S) / ((k_(+2) + k_(-1))/k_(+1) + S)$$

Endmember 1: If the concentration of the substrate is much much bigger than the kinetic ratio (k_(+2)+k_(-1))/k_(+1) then V = k_(+2) * E_(total) which defines V_(max) = k_(cat) * E_(total)

Endmember 2: if the concentration of the substrate is equal to the kinetic ratio (see above) then V = (k_(+2) * E_(total) * S) / (2 * S) = (k_(+2) * E_(total)) / 2 = V_(max) / 2

Now getting back to our lactose model:

Use [Brenda](https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/) to get the enzyme kinetic information.
