# Class notes
## Jan 16 2019
using [Tellurium](tellurium.analogmachine.org) which is built for biological networks (aka metabolic networks)

If you want get Systems Biology: Introduction to Pathway Modeling (on the [analogmachine website](http://books.analogmachine.org/))

Boz wants to be able to go to sites like [Biomodels](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/) (where can browse 10k models) and mess around. Tellurium makes it very easy to import models from Biomodels.

Today let's install and play with some simple models.

Boz's goals for the class:
* get familiar with kinetic modeling platform
* use to reproduce some figures from paper from Halevy and Wing 2014 (sulfate reduction modeling)
* to use platform to calculate isotopic fraction in networks
* to enter a proposed early network and then test it
* another early metabolic network model

### concentration of a single molecule in an E. coli cell
Guess radius to be 1um, so the volume (assuming a cube) is 1um^3. There are 1000L in 1m^3 and 1mL is 1cm3. The volume of the cell in L is 1x10^(-15)L

1 molecule is 1x10^(-24)moles

So the concentration of 1 molecule in an E. coli cell is 1x10^(-9)M aka 1nM so this is the lowest possible concentration of a metabolite/substance of interest in a cell. And while we are in the nM range we can't have halves.

The total concentration of stuff in an E. coli cell is ~100mM.

For the future, use [Bionumbers](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/search.aspx) or [Cell Biology by the Numbers](book.bionumbers.org)

### Running code?!
Successfully ran the simple and slightly more complex examples in the Tellurium Notebook interface

We also tested defining models using the usage example method of defining the model. This also introduces the ability to define compartments.

Book for Earth system model: Mathematical modeling of Earth's Dynamic Systems

For next week, think about explicit examples that you would like to reproduce using this platform (id papers or models). If you have time play with it a little bit. Come in with one new thing that you have discovered. And buy the Systems Bio book!

## Jan 23 2019
Things to not do: biochemistry

Try to find pathways where the steps are known and the kinetics are constrained.

Maybe present models as final SuperLab meeting.

Build a simple graphical representation of the model we want to tackle. We don't want to create new biology, want to take a conceptual model from the literature and build a Tellurium/Antimony model of it.
