Reviewing equations from last week:
0 = A * P (S1-S2)
0 = (Vmax S2)/(Km+S2)

Haven't explicitly defined S3, but since we're consuming S2, we must be making S3.
S1 -> S2 -> "S3"

Steady State
	1) change in concentration is 0
	2) At equilibrium, all net rate is 0, but at steady state, it's constant and all the same!
		~Notice the subtle difference. 

$S1 (species level is constant with $ in antimony)
S3 would accumulate linearly, because constant slope froms steady state. The net rate is thus
the constant accumulation of S3. The accumulation rate = net rate. Can't have steady state if you
don't have  "Openness" because if you keep accumulating, you'll end up hitting EQUILIBRIUM, 
for the forward and back reactions. So, if you have an open system, you're able to continue
accumulating S3. Easy way to do this is to make S1 a $S1, because it implies an open system
to keep "refilling" the S1. 

So, instead of 0,

J(s.s.) =  A * P (S1-S2)
J(s.s.) = (Vmax S2)/(Km+S2)
A = area, P = permeability, S1 = constant
UNITS
Permeability units: Length^2/time/legnth = length / time	
Area = length^2

AP(S1-S2) = (Vmax*S2)/(Km+S2)
Mass/time = , so Vmax needs to be mass/time
Vmax = kcat * Enzyme concentration
vmax units: (Mass of substrate / mass enzyme / time)(Mass enzyme / L^3)
	: Mass substrate / (L^3 * time)

but going back to the previous equation we don't have Length^3 for the Vmax
So this one already includes volume. so we're doing this on a percell basis. 

Converting Vmax enzyme to Vmax cell
Vmax cell = Constant * Vmax enzyme
this constant's units must be length^3, so it must be equal to the volume * V max enzyme
So, this constant is thus the volume of the cell...
Vmax cell = Volume cell * Vmax enzyme.

Area = surface area of the cell. 


mass/Length^3 = molarity so moles/liters 
so, length unit is defined by liters. which is how we get that each length unit is a decimeter. 
L = (liter)^1/3
L = (10^3 cm ^3)^1/3
L = 10 cm
so, length is 1 decimeter.


** is ^. ^ doesn't work.


kcat = property of a single enzyme, so you need to multiply by volume of cell 

Vmax = kcat*volumeofcell*enzymetotal




Lactose code chunk now calculates the steady state concentration of a system.
We did this to do a reality check, and something to peg our model code against.

Simple model to check that the more complicated model is doing the same thing. 

values = LacPath.getSteadyStateValues()
selections = LacPath.steadyStateSelection()
