Making your own model notes

Make the formyl and THF indendent because THF is what is fed back to formate to continue the reaction.

Important question: How to calibrate model? How to validate or verify or test the model?

What is my question? 

What are our assumptions about "boundary" species? Are they constant or changing over time?

Kcat = number of reaction per unit time

V = change in substrate over time -> negative because being consumed

Km = mMolar
Substrate = mMolar

dS/dt = 1/1000 * mol/(L*sec)


kcat is a turnover number. It has dimensions per time. Typically, 1/sec. But to get the units right, remember
that the kcat is the amount of reactions per time, so it's mM substrate / (mM Enzyme * sec). It already
gives you the ratio of substrate to enzyme is built into Kcat. This conversion factor is inherent because
of the definition of Kcat. 

C1 = environment
C2 = cell

There's no difference in identity of S1 and S2, because its just a diffusion process. 
mol S1 / (cm^2 * sec)
It's diffusion based on area. 
dS1/dt Need to come up with a representation of this based on the flux. 
J(A, S1) = Diffusion Constant/delta *(S1-S2)
Diffusion constant unit = Length^2/t
delta = length (length over which you're diffusing
So, P (for permability)= diffusion constant/delta = length / time units

So the overall reaction law we're concerned with
dS1 / dt = A*P(S1 - S2) 

Assume steady state. 
d/dt -> 0 

two laws we have to worry about. First one says 
0 = AP (S1-S2)
0 = Vmax * S2 / (km+ S2)      steady state gives us the 0's here on the left

What's the functional formula solving for S2?

S1 = constant with infinite volume. Won't use up S1.
